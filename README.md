# Database Management application in C++ 
A C++ application that enables users to manage databases using SQL-like commands with built-in data type validation. It supports functionalities to create, modify, query, and manage databases efficiently.

To get started, a queries.txt file is included in the repository, containing sample queries that demonstrate:
- Creating and modifying databases
- Executing queries using the application's custom SQL-like syntax
- Managing data with structured operations.
- saving and loading tables from .txt files.
  
Feel free to explore and modify the queries to fit your needs.
